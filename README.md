#The LetterChart program

LetterChart is a GUI program that lets you open a text file, after which it displays a pie chart with one slice for each letter that appears in the file.

The size of each slice is proportional to the number of times that letter appears in the file. Case is unimportant; 'd' and 'D' are counted together.

Only letters that appear in the file are shown on the pie chart.

Punctuation is ignored.
